                    At Rise of Machine, accessible from
                    https://riseofmachine.com, one of our main priorities is the
                    privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document
                    contains types of information that is collected and recorded
                    by Rise of Machine and how we use it.

                <h2 class="nu-c-h6 nu-u-text--primary">1. Data Collection</h2>
                <p>
                    Rise of Machine is a static website designed to provide
                    information about AI tools. We do not require user
                    registration and do not collect any personally identifiable
                    information (PII) directly from you unless you choose to
                    contact us through external channels (e.g., GitHub or Social
                    Media).
                </p>

                <h2 class="nu-c-h6 nu-u-text--primary">
                    2. Local Storage (Bookmarks)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Our "Saved Tools" feature uses your browser's <strong
                        class="nu-u-text--primary">localStorage</strong
                    > to store the IDs of tools you have bookmarked. This data is
                    stored locally on your device and is never sent to our servers.
                    You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser's
                    cache or using the "Remove" option in the UI.
                </p>

                <h2 class="nu-c-h6 nu-u-text--primary">3. Analytics</h2>
                <p>
                    We use Google Analytics to understand how visitors interact
                    with our website. Google Analytics uses cookies to track
                    anonymized data (e.g., pages visited, session duration).
                    This helps us improve the user experience. You can opt-out
                    by installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like most modern websites, we use cookies to optimize your
                    experience. Cookies are small text files stored on your
                    device that help us remember your preferences (like theme
                    settings) and analyze traffic patterns.
                </p>
