  "description": "Normal Computing was founded in the USA by former members of Google Brain and Google X who helped pioneer AI for the physical world, and developed the leading ML frameworks for Probabilistic and Quantum AI. The infrastructure powering AI models was never designed with today’s scale, complexity, or energy demands in mind. Today's general-purpose architectures underutilize the physical potential of the hardware itself. By aligning hardware design with the intrinsic properties of physical systems, we can transform efficiency. We believe that exploring the limits of new and custom silicon, including those which optimize their own physics, requires the help of AI, better EDA software, and ultimately the realization of a virtuous cycle of self-improving AI hardware. We deliver our software and hardware with the largest semiconductor design and manufacturing institutions, a responsibility which entails individual ownership and deep partnership. We are a diverse, lean team of the world's best engineers, scientists, and operators, with offices in New York City, San Francisco, London, and Copenhagen.",
